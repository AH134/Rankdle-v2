# Rankdle-v2

Rankdle-v2 is inspired by [Rankdle](https://rankdle.com/).

This project is projecting the concepts that I've learned from [FSO](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) with the addition of [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

# Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/AH134/Rankdle-v2.git

2. Create an .env file inside the server folder and add the following

```
MONGODBURI = "URI" (change URI to yours)
```

3. Open 2 terminals for client and server, install & run

```

npm run dev

cd server && npm i
